# Wireshark-Project-Report-TCP-3-Way-Handshake-Stealth-Scan-Analysis
-This report documents a Wireshark analysis performed to observe and validate a TCP 3-way handshake between a host and a destination server on destination specific port. 
-The capture was filtered by TCP port and IP address to isolate the session.
-The analysis covers stealth scanning techniques (stealth/SYN scans, decoy scans, time fragmentation scans), how they can bypass detection, and recommended detection & mitigation strategies.
